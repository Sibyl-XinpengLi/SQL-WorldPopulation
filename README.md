# PortfolioProjects---MySQL

According to UN estimates, the World population reached 8 billion this month. This marks the third time of a billion-person growth milestone. Previous instances occurred in 1999 (6 billion) and 2012 (7 billion). 

In this project, we'll use MySQL to explore and analyze the world population data from The World Bank, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The dataset contains demographic information like: 
total_pop - Country Name, Country Code, The population of each country from 1960 to 2021 
counties_full - Country Code, Region, IncomeGroup, SpecialNotes, TableName
